  Hi! I am Pietro, welcome to my online resume. 
  
  I am a microsystems engineer with a strong training in MEMS.
  This means that I spent a lot of time modeling, designing, building, and testing MEMS, but I also have a 
  functional understanding of circuit design, signal processing, radio communication, and anything
  regarding what is "around" the device.

  At the moment I am working on my Ph.D. with the guidance of Gian Piazza. My thesis will be about
  using highly miniaturized piezoelectric ultrasound transducers to communicate with IoT nodes that are both 
  very small and very low-power (i.e. have long lifetimes).

  Check out the sections below for more details :)

#  Write an awesome description about yourself here, this supports markdown, so you can add [links](http://foobar.com) and highlight things <mark>like this</mark>.
#
#  You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else markdown supports such as
#    - Lists
#    - Tables
#    - <a href="google.com">Links</a>
#    - Imagesssss

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
