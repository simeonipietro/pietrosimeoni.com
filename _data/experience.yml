    I am trying to build piezoelectric ultrasound transducers that occupy areas that are around 1000x smaller 
    than the current state of the art, without sacrificing performance. This is possible thanks to extremely thin (100 nm) AlN layers.

    While the approach is straightforward, most of my work is about finding solutions to the fabrication problems associated 
    with aggressive miniaturization. An example of this is designing a device that is simultaneously resilient to residual 
    stresses and stress gradients in the deposited films.
    The goal of the project is taking advantage of the physics of acoustic waves to build "dust-like" receivers that can function on
    extremly low-power budgets. With this approach, we would be able to use ultrasound to remotely interrogate sensors nodes for up to 
    several years without the need to recharge them.
