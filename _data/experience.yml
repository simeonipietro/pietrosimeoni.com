    I am trying to build piezoelectric ultrasound transducers that occupy areas that are around 1000x smaller 
    than the current state of the art, that operate at low frequency (40-100 kHz), and without sacrificing performance. 
    This is possible thanks to extremely thin (100 nm) AlN layers.

    While the idea is straightforward, most of my work is about finding solutions to the problems that emerge 
    from aggressive miniaturization. An example of this is designing a device that is simultaneously resilient to in-plane 
    stresses in the deposited films and stress gradients that cause out-of-plane bending.
    <br/><br/>
    The goal of the project is to take advantage of the physics of acoustic waves to build "dust-like" receivers that can function on
    extremly low power budgets. With this approach, we would be able to use ultrasound to remotely interrogate sensors nodes 
    without the need to recharge them for several years.
